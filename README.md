# Themes

A test ground for creating themes. This was a few-days experiment on creating and converting a theme with AI. It went alright overall.

## What happened

1. I got a theme generated from bolt.new (very cool)
2. I set up a new project in cursor to use vite and svelte
3. I asked the AI to set up eslint, stylelint, and prettier in the project
4. I did dev on the theme over some days, then realized that the environment sucks
5. I'm going to just implement this theme and theme "system" into my active project, beacuse I don't want to keep track of another project

## What I learned

1. bolt.new is a cool tool for UI stuff (probably more, but I just used it for AI)
2. setting up projects in cursor isn't a very good idea for me. I need to be setting things up manually and then using the AI for specific tasks. It created too much bloat and too many and unknowns.
3. keep pushing forward.
